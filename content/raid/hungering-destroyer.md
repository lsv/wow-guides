This encounter does not have any phases, but just abilities.

## Throughout the encounter
* Melee will stay in a group, behind the boss
* Ranges will stay in a group, just behind the melee group
* Healers will stay in range group
* When you have a gray spinning circle (<a data-wowhead="spell=329298">Gluttonous Miasma</a>) around you, you can not be healed, but the damage should be splitted between other players, so stay in the group.
* If you are targetted with <a data-wowhead="spell=334266">Volatile Ejection</a> (big red arrow pointing to you) you need to run to the side
* On <a data-wowhead="spell=334522">Consume</a> (8 second cast), move away from the boss, the further you are away, less damage you will take, use any self healing, self immunitity etc to help healers
* On <a data-wowhead="spell=329742">Expunge</a> all will get a random sized blue circle, spread out, best if ranges move behind, to make space for melees to also spread
* **Heroic only** Expunge will spawn a blue ball on every player, do not soak these without any immune, fx hunters Aspect of the Turtle, paladin Divine Shield, rogue Cloak of Shadows etc. 

## Tanks
* Tanks taunt off of each other after each <a data-wowhead="spell=329774">Overwhelm</a>, as this also helps keep <a data-wowhead="spell=332295">Growing Hunger</a> stacks low.
