## Phase 1
Dont stand in red pools

* Earsplitting Shriek
  * Move behind pillar and get LOS of boss
* Echolocation
  * Move to the walls
* Exsanguinating Bite
  * Tanks need to use mitigation for this and should taunt after each one of these casts.
* Wave of Blood
  * Healers need to keep the raid healthy when the boss applies this to the raid.

**Heroic only**
* Echoing Screech
  * Bait the this towards an open area and then dodge the sonic rings the boss shoots out.

## Phase 2
The boss jumps to the middle, and after a few seconds the boss will be immune

* Stay 13+ yards away from the boss at all times.
* Dodge the sonic rings that are bouncing around the room.

Every few seconds the boss will cast Earsplitting Shriek
* Use the pillars to get LOS of the boss

When phase 2 ends, it will go back to phase 1
