## Bosses

### Kin-Tara
* Avoid the adds random black bolts.
* Boss has a cleave, don’t face it at the group.
* Interrupt “Dark Lance”.
* When she flies up, everyone spread out. Targeted player needs to move out cloud before the spear hits.

### Ventunax
* Stay out of shadow cloud, avoid the dark bolts.
* “Blinding Flash” - frontal cone that you can dodge, don’t face boss at the group.

### Oryphrion
* Keep grouped, move out of group when you are targetted with <a wow-datahead="spell=323195">Purifying Blast</a>
* Dispel the tank after “Charged Stomp”.
* <a data-wowhead="spell=324444">“Empyreal Ordinance”</a> - Big blue circles you have to move out of, that then become orbs that shoot towards the boss. Try to move the boss out of the circles and soak the orbs before they get to boss. (Each orb soaked will apply a dot to the person that soaked it dealing large damage if you soak many of them, try to have an immunity ready for this – typically a hunters turtle shell, paladin bubble, rogue cloak of shadows etc)

### Devos, Paragon of Doubt
* Stay close to the edge of platform, so the bosses “Run Through” charge doesn’t charge to other side of the room.
* Avoid “Run Through” charge. - Run left or right, not towards or away from boss
* Player will get targeted with a swirly, which drops an orb, which explodes and does damage to people too close to it.
* “Lingering Doubt” - Run away from the group so you can dispelled, drops a puddle that explodes.
* “Anima Conduit” - Pick up blue orbs and run to the conduit in the middle of the room while dodging swirlies.
* Click the spear when it's powered up with anima, throw the spear at the boss, rinse and repeat. (to avoid missing spear try to wait for her to move once as this will give you a 5-7 second window to throw the spear)
