## Bosses

### Kryxis the Voracious
* “Vicious Headbut” does a knockback on the tank, don’t get knocked off the edge.
* Interrupt “Hungering Drain”.
* Stack between the boss and the player targeted with “Juggernaut Rush”.
* “Severing smash” is a group knockback and then orbs are spawned. Soak the orbs before they get to the boss. The damage they deal is flat aoe to the whole group so the same person can soak many orbs (the soaks should be staggered on higher fortified keys or on any tyrannical week – so take 1, heal a bit, take 1 then heal a bit etc this really depends on healer throughput and key level)

### Executor Tarvold
* Stay spread out so “Castigate” circle is only on the player targeted.
* Nuke the add when spawned, the longer its alive the bigger the pool it drops.
* Red lines will rotate around the entire circle of the room you are in. you must alternate between being on the inside of the circle and the outside to avoid the beams. Getting hit by a beam will give you a dot curse. (can be dispelled by mages/druids)

### Grand Protector Beryllia
* “Iron Spikes” large physical damage on the tank.
* Pick up orbs (2 or 3) so you survive “Right of Supremacy”.
* Dodge yellow swirlies on the ground.

### General Kaal
* One player pick up the Naaru looking crystal (typically a melee).
* Stay spread out to avoid the “Wicked Rush” charge stacking on people.
* Move out of the line of red stuff, damage is bigger than the animation.
* “Gloom Squall” - this is when the person with the crystal uses their ability and everyone stacks in the bright yellow circle.

## Notable Trash

### Regal Mistdancer
* Move enemies out of the red pool.

### Grand Overseer
* Interrupt “Curse of Suppression”

### Head Custodian
* Aggros all the neutral mobs around him and buffs one.• Hallway Gauntlet - Make sure someone has the Naaru crystal extra action button. Use it during “Gloom Squall”.

## Covenant Utility

Venthyr users – jars will spawn throughout the dungeon, these can be clicked to create a red circle on the ground. Killing adds in these circles will give the party 5% damage and healing bonus per enemy killed inside it. This buff timer is maxed at a minute and is refreshed with each new stack of the buff up to a maximum of 10 stacks.
