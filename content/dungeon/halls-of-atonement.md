## Bosses

### Halkias, the Sin-Stained Goliath

* Manage the rock patches dropped by the boss on the tank and thrown at range.
* Move the boss to an open area before the fidget spinner beams.
* Fidget spinner beams can change direction.
* Dispel the fear put on a random player.
* **EVERYONE NEEEDS TO STAND IN THE RED CIRCLE AROUND THE BOSS**.

### Echelon

* Avoid red pools.
* Adds explode when they die, try to keep grouped. 
* Cursed player needs to run onto a pool of dead adds before the boss jumps on them to keep adds from respawning. (curse can be dispelled by a druid/ or mage to give the target player more time to move to the adds)

* Interrupt <a data-wowhead="spell=323552">Volley of Power</a> over <a data-wowhead="spell=323538">Bolt of Power</a>.
* Fixated player run the add to the red vessels. Adds work like mario ghosts (don’t move when you face them)
* Avoid red swirls.

* Kill all the neutral tormented souls to stop him from healing.

### Depraved Houndmaster
* casts <a data-wowhead="spell=326450">Loyal beasts</a> that will “Enrage” the Vicious Gargan Bears giving them 100% extra damage, this effect can stack with multiple houndmasters – This cast should be cc’d most of the time if possible

## Covenant Utility

Venthyr users can walk up to “Loyal Stoneborn” adds, and a button will appear, you can then control the adds for a minute giving your group a 20% damage reduction.  
The add itself does good aoe dps (priests can power infusion the add for even more dps).
