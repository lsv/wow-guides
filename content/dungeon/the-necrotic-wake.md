## Bosses

### Blightbone

* “Heaving Retch” cone attack that targets one player and spawns three adds that fixate players. Everyone but the targeted player can dodge the cone. 
* Once adds die they will drop the pool, try to group them up with cc
* Kite the adds if fixated, nuke them if not.
* Manage the pool drops so you have enough room.

### Amarth

* Frontal cone swirlies that you can sidestep.
* Hunter/druid dispel the enrage. 
* Stack boss on crossbow add, interrupt the caster, adds should group up under the boss. (kicking the mages frostbolt volley is the most important part of the adds as it does the highest group wide dps)
* Nuke the adds, focus mages first (adds need to die before the next “final harvest” cast or the group is wiped) and then dodge the corpse explosions.

### Surgeon Stitchflesh

* Clear the whole room.
* Tank the add off to one side of stitchflesh, so people have room to aim the hook.
* Aim the hook at the boss so he gets pulled down to where it can be attacked.
* When the boss is active, still aim the hook at the boss

### Nalthor the Rimebinder

* Move away from the rooted player before dispelling. Range stay spread out to make dispelling easier.
* Dodge swirlies, keep moving until they stop spawning.
* Run through the gauntlet, avoid swirlies, kill the add at the end. (upon returning from gauntlet you will receive 100% crit chance and will drop a frost thing on the floor after 5 seconds – take this to a corner to drop it then use cd’s on boss with the crit buff)

## Notable Trash

### Zolramus Necromancer
* Focus down because adds die when it dies.

### Skeletal Marauders
* Face away from group, frontal cleave, interrupt the fear.

### Workshop Assistants
* Face the arrow through another enemy so they get hit instead of you.

## Covenant Utility

Kyrian users - There are “malfunctioning goliaths” dotted around the dungeon, use your “summon steward” ability and talk to your steward to “fix” the goliath. This will spawn 5 orbs that give bonus damage and healing to your team + some movement speed.
