## Bosses

### Globgrog
* Clear a lot of trash, boss summons adds and has knockback.
* “Plaguestomp” knockback and damages whole group.
* Be close to the boss to dodge “Slime Wave”, group slow from the knockback can make it hard to avoid.
* “Beckon Slime” pull boss to far side from adds spawning, slow, stun, nuke adds before they get to boss.

### Doctor Ickus
* Tank trash leading to the boss on the edges of the platform so you don’t prematurely pull the boss.
* “Sime Injection” - big tank damage, dispellable debuff. Add spawns when it gets removed and needs to be nuked down.
* Tank needs to be in melee range at all times.
* Keep the boss out of red pools. 25% haste buff.
* When he jumps, get to new platform ASAP – Two adds will spawn, focus the bomb casting the long explosion spell. Tanks need to keep the slime add away from the bomb as the slime will reduce all damage to targets around it by 75%

###  Domina Venomblade
* “Brood Assassins” - Find the web on the ground, bring the spider out of stealth and kill it. Dealing any damage or finding invisible adds (hunter flare) in the middle of a web is enough to get the adds to come to you
* “Shadow Ambush” - Giant purple circle, move out and don’t hit others with it.
* Tank will get a poison on them that deals a large amount of damage, druids/monk/paladins should dispel this to help the healer

### Margrave Stradama
* Spawns when you kill all the trash. Green pool gives a bad stacking dot.
* Boss summons an add that puts a circle on the ground, tank needs to be inside of the circle and will take big damage.
* Nuke these adds so two aren’t up at once.
* Boss submerges, little safety dance with tentacles. Either tentacles spread with small gaps all around, or tentacles all together and one large safe area

## Notable Trash

### Fungi Stormer
* CC or stun “Fungistorm”

### Plague Belcher
* Dodge frontal cone, don’t let them touch the blobs that spawn.

### Rotten Slimeclaw
* Stacking debuff, make sure it falls off before next pack.

### Rotmarrow Slime
* “Corrosive Gunk” interrupted.

### Slime Tentacle
* Someone has to be in melee range.

### Congealed slime
* the priority target in any fight, they have an aura that reduces damage around them by 75%
