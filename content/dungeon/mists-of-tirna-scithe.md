## Bosses

### Ingra Maloch
* Save CD’s (Bloodlust/Time warp included) for when the tree add dies, the boss takes 200% increased damage.
* Don’t face tree add at the group. <a data-wowhead="spell=321968">“Enchanted pollen”</a> is a frontal cast.
* Don’t attack Maloch when he does <a data-wowhead="spell=323149">“Embrace Darkness”</a>, reflects increased damage at attacker.
* Dodge swirlies
* Interupt <a data-wowhead="spell=323057">Spirit Bolt</a>

### Mistcaller
* Guessing game - Find the one symbol that doesn’t match the others, usually the one without a circle when the others all have it, or vice versa. Maze mechanic and boss mechanic.
* “Dodgeball” - Straight line targeting each member of the party, can sidestep to avoid the blue arrow pointing at you 
* Don’t let the fox touch you. Explodes and stuns anyone within 8 yards – Fox can be rooted/hunter freezing trapped/stunned/disorientated/polymorph etc (everything except a push back)

### Tred’ova
* Avoid swirlies, green and blue.
* Some adds fixate, don’t let them get to you. Tank picks up the rest. Nuke them down.
* Break the <a data-wowhead="spell=322614">Mind Link</a> beam by running away from each other.
* “Parasitic Pacification” needs to be kicked on every cast – will stun and deal damage to a player every second. Should this cast go off then an add will spawn on top of a target player that needs to be killed in order to stop the damage/stun.

## Notable Trash

### Villagers
* Channel that stuns unless interrupted.

### Mistveil Shaper
* <a data-wowhead="spell=324776">“Bramblethorn Coat”</a> (shield that should be kicked if possible)

### Mistveil Tender
* <a data-wowhead="spell=324914">“Nourish the Forest”</a> cast that needs to be kicked at all times, will apply a heal over time to every enemy healing them for 3% of their hp every second (can be purged by mage spellsteal/priest mass dispel/shaman purge)

### Spinemaw Staghorn
* Interrupt <a data-wowhead="spell=340544">Stimulate Regeneration</a>

## Covenant Utility

Night fae users can unlock the path to the left of the dungeon at the start to avoid some adds.

Just before first boss there is a wall of vines you can click that will unlock to show mushrooms that can clicked – green mushrooms give 10% primary stats and purple mushrooms give 10% stamina.  
There is enough of each type for 1 each (you must pick between green or purple, can’t have both).

Throughout the dungeon their will be “depleted acorns” (dunno exact name) that can be clicked to
set a new spawn position in the dungeon so that when someone dies they release at that acorn.

## Routes

* Coming soon
